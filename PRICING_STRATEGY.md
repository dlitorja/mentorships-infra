- All core features included
- Email support
- Standard onboarding

**Professional Plan - $49/instructor/month**
- Up to 25 active students

- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Custom branding options
- Dedicated onboarding

**Enterprise Plan - $99/instructor/month**

### Option 2: Simple Per-Seat Pricing

**$25-30/instructor/month**
- All features included
- No student limits
- Email support

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand
- Competitive with market
- Low barrier to entry

**Cons:**

- Hard to differentiate value tiers

### Option 3: Value-Based Pricing (Alternative)

**$35/instructor/month** (Recommended starting point)

**Rationale:**
1. **Above basic platforms** ($22) but below premium ($43-53)
2. **Reflects comprehensive feature set** (payments, video, automation)
3. **Room for growth** - Can add tiers later without alienating early customers
4. **Annual discount option**: $350/year (save $70 = ~17% discount)

## Additional Pricing Considerations

### Transaction Fees

**Option A**: Include in base price (simpler, predictable)
- No surprise fees
- Easier to communicate
- May limit high-volume instructors

**Option B**: Add 2-3% on top of payment processor fees
- Scales with instructor success
- Lower base price barrier
- More complex pricing model

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A (included), consider Option B for Enterprise tier.

### Setup/Onboarding Fees

**Starter**: Included in first month
**Professional**: $99 one-time setup fee
**Enterprise**: $199 one-time setup fee (includes custom configuration)

**Rationale**: 
- Covers onboarding costs
- Filters serious customers
- Can be waived for annual commitments

### Free Trial Period

**Recommendation**: 14-30 day free trial
- No credit card required initially
- Full feature access
- Reduces friction for sign-ups
- Can convert to paid after trial

## Pricing Strategy Questions for Discussion

### 1. Target Market
- What's the typical income level of our target instructors?
- Are they currently using other platforms? (Kajabi, Teachable, etc.)
- What's their willingness to pay for a complete solution?

### 2. Competitive Positioning
- Should we position as premium (higher price, more features)?
- Or as affordable alternative (lower price, capture market share)?
- What's our unique selling proposition vs. competitors?

### 3. Revenue Model
- Per-instructor pricing only?
- Or also transaction-based revenue share?
- Should we offer usage-based pricing for high-volume instructors?

### 4. Feature Gating
- Should all features be included at base price?
- Or should we gate advanced features (analytics, custom branding) in higher tiers?
- What features are "must-haves" vs "nice-to-haves"?

### 5. Student Limits
- Should we cap active students per instructor?
- Or charge per active student instead of per instructor?
- What's the typical instructor:student ratio?

### 6. Annual vs Monthly
- What discount should we offer for annual plans?
- Should annual be the default (with monthly as premium)?
- How do we handle prorated refunds?

### 7. Multi-Instructor Organizations
- Should we offer team/organization pricing?
- Volume discounts for multiple instructors?
- How do we handle shared resources (branding, settings)?

## Next Steps

## Notes

- This pricing strategy assumes the platform is fully built and operational

- Monitor competitor pricing changes and adjust accordingly
- Consider regional pricing for international markets
